- Don't use colour in logging mode
  - if bar is included, give it some sensible width

- Bytes, items - use predictable sf (and width)

- Same with :left, :total, :done - use units in the same way (maybe?)

- Rename to value / max_value ?

Tests?

For 2.0...
 - Wide char Unicode support
 - Colors everywhere
 - Fixed size formatting, esp. for multiple bars
 - Handle reversing bars properly
 - Better rate calculation
 - other TODOs like bars disappearing at random times or coming back

 - duplicate lines when logging NOOO

 - finish() doesn't actually block changes?

 - destroy doesn't work 100%. e.g. doesn't consider finished bars to
   be important when moving the cursor down.

 - destroy probably doesn't work with extra-large bars as it only
   moves down 1 line per bar. But it seems to, somehow.

 - refactor the weird scaling stuff at the end
