- Turn into real distribution

- Don't update too often

- Bytes, items - use predictable sf (and width)

- Same with :left, :total, :done - use SF in the same way (maybe?)

Tests?

For 2.0...
 - Wide char Unicode support
 - Colors everywhere
 - Fixed size formatting, esp. for multiple bars
 - Handle reversing bars properly
 - Better rate calculation
 - other TODOs like bars disappearing at random times or coming back

 - finish() doesn't actually block changes?

 - multiline bars (e.g. [bar] then items on left, eta on right)
  - would involve :space or similar object that expands to fill
    all space

 - destroy doesn't work 100%. e.g. doesn't consider finished bars to
   be important when moving the cursor down.
