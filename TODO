- Turn into real distribution

- Clean up API
  - items, count, ???
  - default style to rainbow?

- Don't update too often

Tests?

For 2.0...
 - Wide char Unicode support
 - Colors everywhere
 - Fixed size formatting, esp. for multiple bars
 - Handle reversing bars properly
 - Better rate calculation
 - other TODOs like bars disappearing at random times or coming back

 - finish() doesn't actually block changes?

 - multiline bars (e.g. [bar] then items on left, eta on right)
  - would involve :space or similar object that expands to fill
    all space
