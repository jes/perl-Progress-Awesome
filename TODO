- Don't use colour in logging mode
  - if bar is included, give it some sensible width
  - Don't keep rendering unfinished bars (->finish should stop rendering)
  - Don't render finished bars either

- Bytes, items - use predictable sf (and width)

- Same with :left, :total, :done - use units in the same way (maybe?)

- Fix multibar support
 - multi script overwrites with 'bar 5' x5, then 20x blank space
 - `perl test` outputs 1 extra line

Tests?

Maybe for 1.0
 - rainbow animation based on rate somehow
 - still if no progress / finished

For 2.0...
 - Wide char Unicode support
 - Colors everywhere
 - Fixed size formatting, esp. for multiple bars
 - Handle reversing bars properly
 - Better rate calculation
 - other TODOs like bars disappearing at random times or coming back

 - duplicate lines when logging NOOO

 - finish() doesn't actually block changes?

 - destroy doesn't work 100%. e.g. doesn't consider finished bars to
   be important when moving the cursor down.

 - destroy probably doesn't work with extra-large bars as it only
   moves down 1 line per bar. But it seems to, somehow.

 - seems to go too far down somehow. this happens for both actually
   OMG

 - refactor the weird scaling stuff at the end

 - with 'test', the 'D' bar draws 5 times!
